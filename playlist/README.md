#Comments to the project (todos)

- dark mode implemented in very simplistic way by toggling on body class, to implement full angular theming it would be
  required to use scss or sass for styling
- angular generally generates mobile friendly app, but true mobile friendly app would require to use device recognition and styling (e.g. specialized library like https://nativescript.org)
- implemented very simple item based browser player component, dedicated component would be better e.g. https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-audio-player
- no unit tests nor e2e test have been implemented
- only minimal code comments were written
